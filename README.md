# Kalman
The MATLAB code included here would need to be copy pasted into MATLAB and saved to obtain the proper extension (shown here with .txt). I no longer have MATLAB on my machine so I could not do so myself. The code is for a simple non-linear filter describing a plane moving at constant velocity in x-y space with position measured by range and bearing. The code is also included in the "simple non-linear Kalman filter" word document. The AMSAT fox document contains descriptions of the models for several other non-linear Kalman filters written for that project, along with results of running the filter on simulated data and discussion of tuning.
